# 📊 Comprehensive Analysis of Coffee Orders Data Using Excel

## 1. 📝 Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing coffee order data to gain insights into customer behavior, sales performance, and product popularity. The dataset consists of three key components:

- **Orders Data**: Contains transaction details such as order date, customer ID, product ID, quantity, and sales.
  
- **Customers Data**: Provides information on customer demographics, including country, loyalty status, and contact details.
  
- **Products Data**: Lists product details like coffee type, roast type, size, and pricing.

To make the analysis interactive, a dashboard was created with the following key elements:

### 📑 **Pivot Tables** for:
- 🔝 Top 5 customers by total sales
- 💰 Total sales calculation
- 🌍 Sum of sales per country
    
### 📊 **Dashboard Visualizations** including:
- 📈 Total sales over time (line chart)
- 🌎 Sales by country (bar chart)
- 🏅 Top 5 customers (bar chart)
    
### 🧩 **Slicers** for dynamic filtering by:
- 📅 Order Date
- 🍩 Roast Type Name
- 🍵 Size
- 💳 Loyalty Card

This structured approach allows for effective data exploration and strategic decision-making.

## 2. 🔄 Data Preparation and Transformation

### 🛠️ Handling Missing Values
- Any missing values in sales calculations were handled by ensuring the derived column was correctly computed as: 
  `Sales = Quantity × Unit Price`
- Missing customer details were cross-referenced using Customer ID from the customers dataset.

### 🔗 Data Merging
- The datasets were combined using Customer ID (to fetch customer details) and Product ID (to fetch product pricing and attributes).
- This allowed for a holistic view of each order, including who placed it, what was bought, and how much revenue it generated.

### ➗ Derived Columns
- **Sales**: To measure revenue contribution per order.
- **Customer Segmentation**: To classify customers based on purchase frequency and total spend.
- **Product Segmentation**: To group coffee products based on roast type, size, and country preference.
